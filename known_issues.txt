x page range capacity not implemented
? raise exception is used instead of return False
x updated values are not gotten by get_nth_record
- delete not tested yet
- select_version not implemented yet
- Index not tested yet
- sum is definitely not correct
? reading a record could result in reading a record that has a None RID (because it was deleted). fix select, other methods that get impacted with this problem
x the base record's schema encoding doesn't change for update
